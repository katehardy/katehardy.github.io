      <h2 class = "header2">  <i class="fa-solid fa-child-reaching fa-2x"></i>Know Yourself </h2> 
      <p3> Developing self knowledge is arguably the MOST IMPORTANT step of the process. 
        <br> <br>
        The key for understanding how you think is to reflect on your experiences to discover what you enjoy and are naturally good at. 
        Think back over the last week at work, what were the highlights of the week and why, in what situations did you feel most energised, and what gave you the biggest sense of reward? Make a list of each of these points. Do the same for the last month, and last year - what are the standout highlights, what projects have you worked that gave you the biggest sense of achievement?
        <br> <br>
        Another excellent way to gain a deeper understanding of yourself is by asking others. Though this can seem daunting, other people generally see things in yourself that you cannot. Try asking a work colleage, manager, or friend how they would describe you, your personality and your strengths. Make a list of these.
        <br><br>
        Other ideas to help with self knowledge: 
        <ul class = "fa-ul">
          <li><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i> take identity quizzes e.g. 16 personalities, VARK, communication styles</li>
          <li><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i> listen to self development podcasts</li>
        </ul>
        </p3>

        <h2 class = "header2"> <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open fa-2x"></i> Research</h2>
        <p4>
          Once you have good self knowledge, you can start researching potential career changes, or you may already know what career to go into, if so proceed to the next point.
          <br><br>
          <div class = "bold">Career Tweaking</div>
          Before embarking on a career change, consider whether you current career could be tweaked to provide more job satisfaction. 
          For example someone in IT may find they gain energy from being around people, and so may consider a change to IT support. 
          Career tweaking require less upheaval and uncertainty that comes with career changes, 
          so spend some time considering this before rushing to a full career change. 
          <br> <br>
          <div class = "bold">Side Step</div>
          Another option is to side step into a related field. Considering your current career, are there any related fields that would utilise your personality strengths?  
          For example if you are in a science role and have a logical personality, finds a sense of achievement in creating new things, you may want to consider software development. 
          <br> <br>
          <div class = "bold">Change</div>
          You may be in a career where there is no opportunity to tweak or side step and so require a full industry change. In this case take time to research industries that both suit your personality and are likely to grow. 
          A full career change is a big investment and you do not want to put in a lot of effort to not be able to find a job at the end. 
        </p4>

        <h2 class = "header2"> <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-wide-short fa-2x"></i>Develop Your Skills</h2>
        <p5>
          Once you have a clear career direction you can focus on the skills required for the career change. 
          Skills are the application of knowledge, and all careers require specific skills. 
          Research what skills are required for the career role you are aiming for, use recruitment sites such as LinkedIn to find job descriptions, and make note of the most common skills. 
          <br><br>
          Start with the skills you already have: consider current and previous work, university and hobbies. Make a list of all the skills you are competent in.  
          Now compare this to your research, what gaps are there? Now it's time to upskill. 
          <br><br>
          Ways to develop skills:
          <ul>
            <li>take a course - be sure to research courses thoroughly to see what you would obtain from them. Find course graduates and ask their opinion of the course. 
              Consider whether part/full time is possible, and payment plans.</li>
            <li> find free resources online - e.g. for tech roles many online resources are available e.g. <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a></li>
            <li> volunteering - careers requiring skills like people management and organisation could be obtained through volunteering - and you're helping a good cause!</li>
            </ul>
        </p5>

        <h2 class = "header2"><i class="fa-solid fa-users fa-2x"></i> Grow Your Supporters</h2>
        <p6>
          People need people. We all need support and especially in navigating career change.  
          Start with your immediate friends and family and then their friends, 
          do they know anyone in your chosen industry? Also try the following:
          <br><br>
          <div class = "bold">LinkedIn</div>
          LinkedIn contains a wealth of career information. 
          Utilise your connections, ask any connections you have in the industry for advice on how they got there. 
          Search for career switchers, look up an ideal job title, and filter for people as 1st or 2nd connections. 
          Personalise a connection message to any second connections. 
          Search for recruiters in your chosen industry and ask for their advice on career switching, and what employers are looking for. 
          Most people are usually willing to help!
          <br><br>
          <div class = "bold">Your Local Area</div>
          See if there are any career events in your local area, such as a career fair. 
          Look for any relevant meet up happening near you, there will likely be more events in your closest city.
          <br><br>
          <div class = "bold">Be Open and Positive</div>
          You never know who you might meet in your day to day life, at an social gathering,  
          hobby or activity, so be open and share your career journey with others. 
          You never know, you could be talking to a hiring manager!
