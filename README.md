👩‍🔬 I am a Scientist with a passion for programming.

💻 Currently completing courses on Python for data science, SQL for data analysis, and HTML/CSS/JS for website development.

👀 As I complete my courses I will post my projects here, feel free to take a look around, I'm open to feedback. And stay tuned, I will update my projects as I continue my         coding journey.
